It can be observed from the Citi Bike data that the Number of trips taken by </div><div>Subscribers&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>are</div><div>high during the weekdays and Number of trips taken by Customers are high during as compared to the weekends. This might be attributed to the fact that the users who use the Citi-Bikes regularly for work commute subscribe to the Annual Plan. The Ratio of Customers to Subscribers utilizing the service is high on weekends and low on the weekends. A Z-Test was conducted to prove the correlation of this study and confirmed the fact that Subscribers take more rides than the Customers during Weekdays.</div></div><div><div>&nbsp;<b>Introduction:</b> Citi-Bike a Bike Sharing Platform that began its operations&nbsp;</div><div>at</div><div>NYC in 2013 has over 10,00 vehicles, 706 Stations and serviced over 22 Million rides until 2016&nbsp;[1]. They operate on two methodologies i. Citi-bike Annual Subscription service for Subscribers and ii. A 24-hour pass or a 3-day pass for Customers&nbsp;[2]. In this&nbsp;Article, we try to derive a correlation between the No. of Rides taken by Subscribers to the No. of Rides taken by the Customers during Weekdays and Weekends. This will help us derive a conclusion on whether Citi-Bike is used for more as a Daily Commute mode or by Tourists to explore the city.</div><div><b>Data-Analysis:</b> To perform this analysis, we utilize the publicly available dataset posted by the Citi-Bike for the month of January 2017 which is available at this link (<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html">https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html</a>) .</div><div></div><div>We then clean the dataset to the required parameters of User Type, No. of Trips Taken, and the Day of the Trip.&nbsp; To Simplify the analysis, and since the User Type data is dichotomous (Either Customer or Subscriber) we assign them a Binary Value of 0 &amp; 1 respectively and filter out the individual trip counts on Weekdays and Weekends.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>    </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><div></div></div><div></div>
